# Official NZSL Dictionary App for Android devices

This repository holds the code necessary to develop the NZSL Dictionary App for Android. This codebase can be imported into Android Studio and you are invited to fork it to add features and bug fixes.

The original code was developed by [Greg Hewgill](http://hewgill.com/) and generously gifted to the [Deaf Studies Research Unit](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/centres-and-institutes/dsru) of [Victoria University of Wellignton](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/). It is maintained by [Ackama](http://www.ackama.com/). 

# Missing images?

This repository does not include images for the database of signs. We have created [an importer script](https://github.com/ODNZSL/nzsl-dictionary-scripts) that will fetch the latest images from the VUW servers and place them in the correct folder. You should run this once when you start development. Signs are updated every few months.

# Android and iOS features

We maintain an iOS and Android version of the app and it is our preference to keep features standard between both apps. We would love you to check out the [iOS App code](https://github.com/ODNZSL/nzsl-dictionary-ios) and consider contributing to both via Github Pull Requests.
